# AutoLearn Agent – Multi-Agent Learning System

AutoLearn Agent is an AI-powered autonomous learning assistant that uses multi-agent architecture to generate, evaluate, and refine explanations using dynamic reasoning loops.

This project was created for the Kaggle Agents Intensive Capstone Project.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-agent architecture (Generator + Critic + Refiner)
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Self-improvement loop
- Evaluation scoring
- Knowledge tagging
- Modular codebase

## 📁 Files
- generator.py
- critic.py
- refiner.py
- main.py

## 🧠 How it works
The Generator produces an explanation,  
The Critic evaluates it,  
The Refiner improves it,  
Loop continues until score > threshold.
